As with the last lab, you will begin by checking that the sensing circuit works and that the projector is correctly connected to the computer. Next, you will write code to generate the multipixel pattern that the projector will use to scan through the image. Finally you will use your code and scanning matrix to image a card!"

This meant if our image had $n$ pixels, $H$ had $n$ columns, and our image was therefore scanned exactly $n$ times (once per pixel). So, for a 2x2 image, H would need exactly 4 columns (one for each mask) and we would make 4 scans.\n",

But how can we illuminate every pixel in a 2x2 image more than once while using only 4 scans and 4 corresponding imaging masks? The solution is to illuminate more than one pixel per mask, which motivates the question, how does one choose which pixels to illuminate in each mask?\n",
