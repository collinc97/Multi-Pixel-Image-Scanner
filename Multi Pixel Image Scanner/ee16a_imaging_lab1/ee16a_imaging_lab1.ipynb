The physical components of this system include a projector, a solar cell, a sensing circuit, and a [TI MSP430](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpad.html?DCMP=rtos&HQS=ep-sdo-rtos-pr-lp-launchpad-en) microcontroller. The completed setup of the imaging system is shown below in figure 1. \n",

    "Figure 2 is a high-level block model of our imaging system: 1) The solar cell receives photons reflecting off of an object and outputs a voltage signal. 2) This signal travels through a circuit to \"improve\" the quality of the signal. 3) A computer (in this case a microcontroller) reads this improved circuit and coverts what it sees to a digital representation of the object being imaged. 4) Further improvements are made via software to increase the quality of the image.\n",

    "Digital images are composed of a grid of [pixels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel), each of which represents a single color. To create a digital representation, optical imaging systems measure the energy, equivalent to light in this case, reflected off of objects to determine the values of these pixels. Because different colors reflect different amounts of light, measurements of reflected light intensity can be used to differentiate between colors.\n",

    "Commercial cameras, such as those found in smartphones, use chips called CMOS image sensors to measure millions of pixel values at a time (think of this as millions of devices akin to the solar cell that all fit on an approximately 30mm$^2$ chip). In contrast, our system can only measure one light intensity value at a time, so we will instead use a controlled energy source, the projector, to illuminate specific regions of the image one region at a time. We then use the solar cell to record the energy that reflects off of each region.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The solar cell converts light to induce a flow of electrons, and the circuit then outputs a voltage corresponding to light intensity. The specific configuration of the circuit sets the solar cell up so it is most sensitive to changes in light. \n",

    "This changing voltage is now a set of real numbers and much closer to something we can use to represent our image on a computer. We use a microcontroller(TI Launchpad MSP430) to take samples of the signal and convert it to a set of numbers we can then use in IPython.\n",

Because a voltage requires two points to define, it is often convenient to define a common point in a circuit as a reference. This reference voltage, commonly referred to as \"ground\" is defined by convention to be 0V, and therefore allows us to conveniently describe voltages at any point in the circuit with respect to 0.  \n",

Instead, the device executes a single function continuously in a loop when it is powered on.
